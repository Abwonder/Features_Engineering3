    " What is the purpose of Min-Max Scaling?\n",

    "    To remove outliers from the data\n",
    "\n",
    "    To perform feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Min-Max Scaling, also known as normalization, transforms the data into a range of [0,1] by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range. This is useful when the scale of the features varies widely, as it ensures that all features have equal importance in the analysis.\n",
    "2.\n",

    "What is Feature Extraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The process of selecting the most important features from a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "     The process of transforming data into a different representation\n",

    "    The process of removing outliers from a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Feature Extraction is the process of transforming data into a different representation that is more suitable for analysis. This can involve selecting the most important features, combining features, or creating new features based on the existing ones.\n",
    "3.\n",
    "\n",
    " What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A feature extraction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a feature extraction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information. It does this by finding the principal components, which are the linear combinations of the original features that explain the most variance in the data.\n",

    "    To reduce the dimensionality of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "    To remove outliers from the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The main purpose of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by finding the principal components that explain the most variance in the data. This is useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, as it allows for easier visualization and analysis of the data.\n",
